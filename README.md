This is the fourth project of the software engineering immersive course at GA London. The assignment was to create a **full-stack application** using **Django REST Framework to serve data from a Postgres database**.

Artist_Flow is a platform that allows users to explore and discover new artists. In addition, users are able to store their favourite artists and find out more information regarding specific artists i.e. upcoming events they are playing at, information regarding specific events etc.

You can launch the app on Heroku [here](https://artist-flow-ga.herokuapp.com/#/), or find the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/jgar123/artist_Flow).

## Brief
â€‹
* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own backend and your own front-end
* **Use a Python Django API** using Django REST Framework to serve your data from a Postgres database
* **Consume your API with a separate front-end** built with React
* **Be a complete product** which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* **Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes** that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible.
